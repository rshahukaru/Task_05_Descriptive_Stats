You are given Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse season stats (CSV pasted below).
Rules:
- Use ONLY the provided data; no outside info.
- Show your working and intermediate tables.
- If a needed column is missing, say so and skip that step.

Tasks:
1) Preview: show a 6-row table with the exact columns you detect.
2) Descriptives: mean/median/std for G, A, PTS. If present, compute per-game rates (*_pg) and shot_pct = G/SH.
3) Leaderboards: top-5 by pts_pg and by shot_pct (require GP ≥ 8 if GP exists).
4) Visuals: histogram of pts_pg and scatter of SH vs G with a best-fit line; if you can run Python, do so and show code; otherwise describe the exact bins/axes and computed correlation.
Return: numbered sections with markdown tables.
