If you can execute Python, write code to:
- Load the pasted CSV as a DataFrame named df.
- Create pts_pg if possible (requires GP and PTS).
- Plot: (1) histogram of pts_pg; (2) scatter of SH vs G with a fitted line and printed correlation.
- Print the top-5 players by pts_pg and shot_pct.
Ensure the code runs end-to-end with no external files.
